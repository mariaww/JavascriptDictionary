/* Using the .addEventListener() method, we can have a DOM element listen for a specific event and execute a block of code when the event is detected. 
The DOM element that listens for an event is called the event target and the block of code that runs when the event happens is called the event handler. */

// 1)We selected our event target from the DOM using 'document.getElementById('targetElement').'
// 2)We used the '.addEventListener()' method on the 'eventTarget' DOM element.
// 3)The '.addEventListener()' method takes two arguments: an event name in string format and an event handler function. We will learn about different values we can use as event names in a later lesson.
// 4)In this example, we used the 'click' event, which fires when the user clicks on 'eventTarget'.
// 5)The code block in the event handler function will execute when the 'click' event is detected.

let eventTarget = document.getElementById('targetElement');

eventTarget.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // this block of code will run when click event happens on eventTarget element
});

// 6)The named function eventHandlerFunction is passed as the second argument of the .addEventListener() method instead of defining an anonymous function within the method!

function eventHandlerFunction() {
  // this block of code will run when click event happens
}
